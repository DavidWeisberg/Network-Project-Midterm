Readme file for CSC 5250 - Midterm 1

Instructions for proxy.c
In terminal cd to directory containing proxy.c
type gcc proxy.c -o proxy
type ./proxy &
Open your browser and set the proxy ip to 127.0.0.1 and the port to whatever port the proxy command displayed.
Browse the internet

Instructions for newProxy.cpp
In terminal cd to directory containing newProxy.cpp
type g++ newProxy.cpp -o proxy
type ./proxy
Open your browser and set the proxy ip to 127.0.0.1 and the port to whatever port the proxy command displayed.
Browse the internet.

Troubleshoot:
If you recieve the error "Error: Address already in use"
type netstat -tulpn
see if a process is listening and kill it by typing
kill PID <PID # HERE>


More Information:
Which content is cacheable in your proxy cache? and how do you calculate their TTL time?
  - I know proxy.c does not have a cache nor does it calculate TTL time. As far as I can tell proxy.cpp does not have a cache/TTL calculation either.
  
A list of files and a 1-line description of the contents of each file.
  - header.h includes a list of headers and defintions used for proxy.c
  - proxy.c is the proxy I wrote from scratchthat is unable to connect to a host.
  - newProxy.cpp is proxy code I found onlineand modified to work with the requested server output of this midterm.
  
The responsibility of each group members.
  - David Weisberg wrote proxy.c, header.h, and this README. I also found the code for newProxy.cpp modified it for the project and tested all the code.
  
References to any borrowed code (the source code must also include this information).
  - The majority of newProxy.cpp is borrowed code which was found at http://www.blizzhackers.cc/viewtopic.php?t=443832 . The code was modified to match the requested ouput for this midterm project.
  
A description of any known problems. If you think you know how to solve the problem(s) and simply didn't have time to do so - explain how!
  - Known problems for newProxy.cpp include not having a cache or calculating TTL time. Problems also include some pages having "Content Encoding Errors" where the page had an unsupported form of copression. Sometimes the server stops displaying the requests. The servermight crash if you kill the client. It also sometimes doen't load images.
  - Known problems for proxy.c include, pretty much everything, and the inability to connect to the host after extracting the host from the browser request. newProxy.cpp had this working and I attempted to imitate what it was doing but was unsucessful. The problem was the gethostbyname() function and setting the server address to the one it should have provided. I tried using getaddrinfo() and this also didn't work.
  
Anything else you think might be useful to share, such as what you learned, what you had trouble with, if the project was too hard or too easy, etc.
  - I had trouble with pretty much everything after displaying the port, IP, and the request. My first big problem occured with extracting the host from the bowser request but my biggest problem was setting up a new socket for the host to connect on to forward the browser request. I didn't even have time to work on the cache or TTL becasue of all the problems I had. I would say this project was too hard and pretty confusing.
